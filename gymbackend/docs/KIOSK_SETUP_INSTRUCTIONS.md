# 🏋️ Kiosk System Setup & Testing Instructions

## 🚀 What We Built

A **fully automatic fingerprint check-in kiosk** that identifies gym members and checks them in without any manual interaction!

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. **Start the System**
```bash
# Backend (Django)
cd fitnessbackend
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend (React)  
cd fitness-frontend
npm start
```

### 2. **Register a Member's Fingerprint** (One-time setup)
1. **Login as a member** at `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. **Go to Attendance page** at `http://localhost:3000/member-dashboard/attendance`
3. **Click "Register Fingerprint"**
4. **Follow the browser prompt** to register your fingerprint
5. **Verify registration** shows "Fingerprint registered successfully!"

### 3. **Access the Kiosk**
1. **Open kiosk URL**: `http://localhost:3000/kiosk`
2. **Make it fullscreen** (F11 in most browsers)
3. **Position near your laptop's fingerprint sensor**

## 🎯 How to Test

### **Automatic Check-in Flow:**
